								<h2>COMP 110 : Introduction to Programming and Data Science</h2>
								<p>Introduces students to programming and data science from a computational perspective. With an emphasis on modern applications in society, students gain experience with problem decomposition, algorithms for data analysis, abstraction design, and ethics in computing.</p>
								<br>
								<h2>AP Computer Science A</h2>
								<p>The course introduces students to computer science with fundamental topics that include problem solving, design strategies and methodologies, organization of data (data structures), approaches to processing data (algorithms), analysis of potential solutions, and the ethical and social implications of computing. The course emphasizes both object-oriented and imperative problem solving and design using Java language. Foundational concepts include data types, sequences, boolean logic, control flow, functions/methods, recursion, classes/objects, input/output, data organization, transformations, and visualizations. </p>
								<br>
								<h2>INLS 161 : Tools for Information Literacy</h2>
								<p>Curriculum includes software use and maintenance, computer applications, and networked information systems. Implementation, design and creation of web pages using basic HTML, basic CSS, and basic server-side and client-side scripting. </p>
								<br>
								<h2>AP Calculus ab</h2>
								<p>The course introduces students to computer science with fundamental topics that include problem solving, design strategies and methodologies, organization of data (data structures), approaches to processing data (algorithms), analysis of potential solutions, and the ethical and social implications of computing. The course emphasizes both object-oriented and imperative problem solving and design using Java language.</p>
								<br>
								<h2>AP Physics i</h2>
								<p>Through this course students cultivate their understanding of physics through inquiry-based investigations as they explore these topics: kinematics; dynamics; circular motion and gravitation; energy; momentum; simple harmonic motion; torque and rotational motion; electric charge and electric force; DC circuits; and mechanical waves and sound.</p>
								<br>
								<h2>ENGL 105i : Writing in Digital Humanities</h2>
								<p>This course explores the impact of technology on society and the uses of new digital methods to analyze traditional materials in the Humanities, such as texts, objects, and archives. students can expect to learn to compose digital environments, generate metadata, create data visualizations for an academic purpose, and to work with groups using a project management approach and software.</p>

									<p>Throughout high school, I led and participated in organizations addressing the gender gap in technology, such as <strong>GirlsWhoCode</strong> and <strong>UNC's Women in Computer Science</strong>.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>Through my leadership, I received the <strong> 2023 NCWIT Award for Aspirations in Computing as the Raleigh Durham Coast Affiliate Award Winner.</strong></p>
								</li>
						
								<li>
									<p>During the summer, I worked as a <strong>Website Developer</strong> and <strong>Intern</strong> for Connect In Place, an educational non-profit.</p>
								</li>
						
								<li>
									<p>Currently, I am a <strong>Project Team Member </strong> for the <strong>UNC's Computer Science + Social Good Organization</strong> , collaberating with a team to enhance and implement new software systems for clients using Figma and React.</p>
								</li>
						
								<li>
									<p>Additionally, I am the <strong> Curriculum Development Specialist</strong> for<strong> Carolina Analytics & Data Science's Data World Program</strong>, which aims to support and create data science education for local high schools. I manage and design educational material for the <strong>Applied Machine Learning course</strong>.</p>
								</li>
						
								<li>
									<p>I've also been involved with and discovered a passion for <strong>UNC's hackathons</strong>, providing valuable hands-on experience with various projects. For example, the <strong><a href="https://devpost.com/software/random-forest-fire-regression?ref_content=user-portfolio&ref_feature=in_progress">Carolina Data Challenge</a></strong>. </p>
